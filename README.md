## My process
I decided to challenge myself in building with pure html and css for this exercise.
I used CSS flexbox to size the contents and utilized media query to make the content responsive to different devices screen width.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to use the tools that are built within pure css to design the UI of this challenge. This is my first time building website content from scratch based on a screenshot of the sample. I use all available resource like youtube and freecodecamp to build this during my free time to challenge myself in learning frontend developer designing task.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve upon this challenge when i have learned more concepts and better way for designing website.
My current design still lack some responsiveness if the size of the screen width is too awkward, and i wish to design it again to accustom to all of this situation

### Useful resources

- [Introduction To Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&list=PLlQ0SaBmA1kzcFQ0zKHkNBIJRE1I_g2RF&index=1&t=4116s) - This helped me in understanding the basics of a responsive website design. I really liked the way the presenter of this video presented his views and I will use it going forward.
